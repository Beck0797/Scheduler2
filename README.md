## Desciption
Managing classes is easier and more convenient than ever. :tada: <br/>
Our team consists of students which mean that we know how challenging it is to manage attendance and assignments from a number of classes. Therefore, we did our best to develop the software that may help to overcome those difficulties. Our app allows users to:
- [x] Register classes.
- [x] Set alarms before each class.
- [x] Get notified before assignment deadlines.
- [x] Have your online classes links notified before each class.
- [x] Get detailed attendance reports.
